This project is an end-to-end demonstration of fine-tuning a pretrained Transformer model for a text classification task. I use the `distilbert-base-uncased` model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset, classifying reviews as either **positive** or **negative**.

The entire workflow, from data loading to model deployment, is containerized in the main Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Objective

The goal is to build a reliable sentiment classifier by fine-tuning a modern NLP model and deploying it for inference on the Hugging Face Hub. This serves as a practical example of applying transfer learning to solve a common real-world problem.

## Features

* **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Loads the `imdb` dataset directly from the Hugging Face Hub and tokenizes it using the `distilbert` tokenizer.
* **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tunes the `distilbert-base-uncased` model for sequence classification using the high-level `Trainer` API from the `transformers` library.
* **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using standard classification metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. Visualizes results with a confusion matrix.
* **Inference:** Provides a simple function and `pipeline` to test the model on new, unseen text.
* **Deployment:** The final fine-tuned model is saved and pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access and deployment.

## Deployed Model on Hugging Face Hub

The final model is publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub. You can use it for inference directly in your own projects with just a few lines of code.

**Model Hub Link:** [**timkilikimtai/distilbert-imdb-sentiment-analysis**](https://huggingface.co/timkilikimtai/distilbert-imdb-sentiment-analysis)

### Quick Inference

To use the model, install the `transformers` library (`pip install transformers`) and run the following Python code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the sentiment analysis pipeline with our fine-tuned model
pipe = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="timothykimutai/distilbert-imdb-sentiment-analysis")

# Example 1: Positive review
result_pos = pipe("This movie was an absolute masterpiece! The acting was superb.")
print(result_pos)
# Output: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.99...}]

# Example 2: Negative review
result_neg = pipe("I was really disappointed. The story was predictable and boring.")
print(result_neg)
# Output: [{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99...}]
```
